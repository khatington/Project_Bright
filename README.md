## Project Bright ðŸ’¡
CS171 Computer Systems 1 project. <br/>
Theme: Sustainability and Environment.<br/> 

My project is inspired by my idea for my `LC_project` where I've created a smart home device for home users. <br/>

### About
`Project Bright` is an imitation of a smart app where the home owner can control their smart lighting system and track the duration of lights in every room of their house through a simple smart device.<br/>

This devices enables the user to: </br>
- control the light through an interactive UI. <br/>
- be alerted if lights are on for too long. <br/>
- know the duration of lights being on in each room of their house. <br/>

> Note: This is a very simple program and UI. The time is set to seconds instead of minutes to demonstrate its functionality quickly. <br/>
