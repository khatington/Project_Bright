# Project Bright 💡

CS171 Computer Systems 1 project <br/>
Theme: Sustainability and Environment<br/> 

My project is inspired by my idea for my LC_project where I've created a smart home device for home users. <br/>
The project itself is an imitation of a smart app where the home owner can control their smart lighting system and track the duration of lights in every room of their house through a simple smart device.<br/>

This devices enables the user to: </br>
💡control the light through an interactive UI <br/>
💡be alerted if lights are on for too long <br/>
💡know the duration of lights being on in each room of their house <br/>

Note: This is a very simple program and UI, the time is set to seconds instead of minutes to demonstrate its functionality quickly. <br/>
